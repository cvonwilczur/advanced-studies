Secure Shell - ssh

SSH is a protocol, or language through which machines communicate with each other. Examples of this include HTTP, FTP, HTTPS etc.

The shell, unlike the browser, allows you to interact with the computer directly. SSH will allow you to communicate directly with another computer, and SSH does so securely.

For example, you can ssh into a server hosted on Digital Ocean and make changes to that server.

ssh {user}@{host}
