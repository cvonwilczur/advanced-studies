#React Tools

React at the end of the day is a view layer library. It has some simple solutions, but you will need to add onto React to build out a more fully-featured app.

## React Router

Responsible for routing. Changing pages and changing routes in our URL.

## Ramda or Lodash

A utility library that adds additional functional flavor. 

## Glamorous, Styled Components, CSS Modules

Additional/smart functionality for working with styles in React.

## Gatsby

Fast static-site generator in React. 

## Next.js

Extremely popular for server-side apps.

## Material-UI / Semantic UI

Because we can build reusable components, Material-UI offers easy-to-use React components.

## Reselect, Redux-saga, immutable.js

Tools that make using Redux easier. Reselect improves the performance of apps, where Redux-saga might help handle asynchronous actions better than thunk. Immutable enforces immutability in the state.
